this is a q a excerpt on the topic of artificial intelligence from a lecture by richard feynman from september 26 1985 i re-record the audience questions because they're barely audible in the original question do you think there will ever be a machine that will think like human beings and be more intelligent than human beings first of all they think like human beings i would say no and i'll explain in a minute why i say no and second that they'd be more intelligent in human beings is a question intelligence is to be defined if you would ask me are they better chess players than any human being possibly can be yes i get you someday are they best better chess players than most human beings right now one of the things by the way that we always do is we want the don machine to be better than anybody not just better than us if we find a machine that can play chess better than us it doesn't impress us much we keep saying and what happens when it comes up against the masters we imagine that we human beings are equivalent to the masters in everything right the machine has to be better than a person in everything that the best person does at the best level okay but it's hard on the machine but with regard to the question of whether to make it to think like a machine my opinion is based on the following idea that we try to make these things work as efficiently as we can with the materials that we have materials are different than nerves and so on

if we would like to make something that runs rapidly over the ground and we could watch a cheetah running we could try to make a machine that runs like a cheetah but it's easier to make a machine with wheels with fast wheels or something that flies just above the ground in the air when we make a bird the the airplanes don't fly like a bird they fly but they don't fly like a bird okay so they don't flap the wings exactly they have in front another guy with a gadget that goes around or the more modern airplane has a tube that you heat the air and squirt it out the back uh a jet propulsion a jet engine uh has an internal rotating fans and so on and it uses gasoline it's different right so there's no question that the later machines are not going to think like people think in that sense with regard to intelligence i think it's exactly the same way for example they're not going to do arithmetic the same way as we do arithmetic but they'll do it better let's take mathematic very elementary mathematics arithmetic they do arithmetic better than anybody much faster and differently but it's fundamentally the same because in the end the numbers are equivalent right so that's a good example of we're never going to change how they do arithmetic to make it more like humans that would be going backwards because the arithmetic done by humans is slow cumbersome and confused and full of errors where these guys are fast if one compares what computers can do to the human beings we find the following rather interesting comparisons the first of all if i give a human being a problem like this i'm going to ask you for these numbers back every other one in reverse order please right now i'm going to series of numbers and i want you to give them to me back and reverse order every other one i'll tell you i'll make it easy for you just give me the numbers back the way i gave them to you you ready one seven three nine two six five eight three one seven two six three anybody gotta gonna be able to do that no and that's more than not more than twenty or thirty numbers but uh you can give a computer fifty thousand numbers like that and asking for them any reverse order the sum of them or do different things with them and so on and it doesn't forget them for a long time etc so there are some things that a computer does much better than a human and you'd better remember that if you kind of compare machines to humans but what the human has to do for his own always they always do this they always try to find one thing don it that they can do better than the computer so we now know many many things that the humans can do better than the computer she's walking down the street and she's got a certain kind of a wiggle and you know that's jane right or the sky's going in and you see his hair flip just a little bit it's hard to see he's at a distance but that particular funny way that the back of his head looks that's jack okay

to recognize things to recognize patterns seems to be something we have not been able to put into a definite procedure you would say i have a good procedure for recognizing jack just take a lots of pictures of jack by the way a picture can be put into the computer in fact by this method here if this were very much finer i could tell whether it's black and white at different spots you know in fact you get pictures in the newspaper by black and white dots and if you do stew it fine enough you can't see the dots so with enough information i can load pictures in so you put all the pictures of of jack on the different circumstances and ask the machine to compare it the trouble is that the actual new circumstance is different the lighting is different the distance is different the tilt of the head is different and you have to figure out how to allow for all that and it's so complicated and elaborate that even with the large machines with the amount of storage that's available and the speed that they go we can't make figure out how to make a definite procedure that works at all or at least it works anywhere within a reasonable speed so recognizing things is difficult for the machines at the present time and some of those things are done in a snap by a person so there are things that humans can do that we don't know how to do in a filing system so uh it is recognition and that brings me back to something i left which is what kind of a file clerk can't be imitated by the machine a file clerk that has some special skill which represents which requires recognition of a complicated kind for instance the fire kirk in the fingerprint department which looks the fingerprints and then makes a careful comparison to see if these fingerprints match is not been is just about ready to be it's hard to do it almost possible to do by a computer you'd say there's nothing to it i look at the two fingerprints and see if all the black dots are the same but of course it's not the case the finger was dirty the print was made at a different angle the pressure was different and the ridges are not exactly in the same place if you were trying to match the exactly the same picture it would be easy but where the center of the print is which way the finger is turned whether it's been squashed a little more a little bit less where there's some dirt on the finger whether in the meantime he got a wart on his thumb and so forth are all complications these little complications make the comparison so much more difficult for the machine for the blind filing clerk system that is too much much much too slow to be certainly utterly impractical almost at the present time i don't know where they stand but they're going fast trying to do it whereas a human can go across all that somehow just like they do in the chess game they seem to be able to catch on to patterns rapidly and we don't know how to do that rapidly automatically audience question can computers discover new ideas and relationships by themselves well it depends what you mean themselves and it's uh it's hard to discover new relationships that computers can do uh there have been computers which do things like uh problems uh theorem proving in geometry or something in which they've converted the problem of finding a proof of a theorem into a definite procedure okay and once you do that although it's an elaborate and dumb way to do proofs they can do it the present time a computer can't do all the different things that a person can do you know it's it's very difficult to find some way of defining rather precisely something we can do that we can say a computer will never be able to do

there are some things that people make up that say that while it's doing it will it feel good or while it's doing it will it uh understand what it's doing or some other abstraction i'd rather feel that these are things like while it's doing it will it be able to scratch the lice out of its hair no it hasn't got any hair the lies to scratch from okay so uh there are if you got to be careful when you say what the human does if you add to the actual result of his effort some other things that you like the appreciation of the aesthetic or you didn't do that i'm not saying you did but a lot of people do that when they ask questions and if we add things that we think we're doing on top of what we're actually doing just look at not just the result of what we're doing but a lot of extra things then it gets harder and harder for the computer to do it because the human beings have a tendency to try to make sure that they can do something that no machine can do somehow it doesn't bother them anymore it must have bothered them in early times that machines are stronger physically than they are they can lift weights that are heavier than people they can move things faster than people it can run faster we can fly you can do just terrible strengths and so forth and we don't still sit around worrying that there's some way that the man can turn his hand that some machine can't do that we can easily make machines that are better than us in predicting the the weather for instance because what you do to predict the weather is to look at old records and see when the circumstances were similar and guess that the results will be similar added to that a certain amount of analysis of the movement of wind according to the laws of physics and the amount of hocus pocus put together okay now the speed will be higher and the effectiveness of the predictions greater if you could look at more cases so you get a better chance of getting one closer and put more a longer and more elaborate calculation including more variables which is too hard for us to in time to make the prediction now we have to make the prediction of the weather let's say the weather for three days from now has to be predicted in three days or the damn thing is useless right and we work at a certain speed but the computers work faster and can do more and therefore for instance for weather prediction in the end maybe not today but someday it's not at all inconceivable that the machine could do weather prediction faster and more effectively and more accurately than we do we will have however given it the procedure now the question is what happens if we don't give it the procedure well a man they've people have tried that this game of giving it instead of a direct procedure a kind of what it has been called heuristics try an analogy to get a new idea of how to do something compare this to that try an extreme case etc and uh a man by the name of lynette has gone the furthest with this do i have time how much time do i have because we want to see these slides what time i know that's interesting information but how much how much time do i have it's time for the slideshow now since i have no more time i will say no more about the subject no but it takes a few minutes that's why i asked for the time okay you make this machine which was again a filing cabinet you understand what it does is it looks it tries to find the answer to something by looking at the different possible possibilities but which ones he tries is something like patterns in the chest instead of everything it says try moves near the center of the board first you know and never mind the ones in the corner or something like that or some sorts of principles and he first applied it to a kind of naval game and it's a game that people play in california which is all organized according to rules it's kind of fun someone sets out all the rules dreadnoughts cost this much armor costs this much guns cost this much and so forth and you got this much budget for your navy and you're going to make various kinds of ships with different kinds of armaments and then this kind of a ship armament of a certain thickness that costs a certain amount can only resist shells of a certain strength you know and so on so you try to with the money arrange to buy diff to design different kinds of ships uh so that your navy is better than the next one then when they're brought together there's ways of calculating what there's not real navies it's a game which is the best one and all the rules are laid out in a great big volume okay of the cost of everything and the power of everything and armor-piercing possibilities and so on and it's a nice game and mr lynette tried to his program on this game and put into his program heuristics like try the extreme case and things like that and uh he won the championship in california of course it did an awful lot of trying of different cases you see but it didn't try every case not like the chess game there were too many things but it was guided by its own stuff now inside of that was this that if you got a better navy by your own calculation and you used one of the heuristics mark that heuristic up a notch as being more valuable now use the most valuable heuristics first see so that the ability of the machine depended on his learning so to speak which ones of his tricks works most effectively most of the time and then they become more used so it's just exactly what you would like to make it look intelligent well he won and how did he win it turned out that year he won by making one great big battleship with all the armor on it which was so silly but when you go to calculate sure enough it's better than any of the normal things which nobody thought of but his machine thought next year he entered again and this time he won by making taking all his money and making 100 000 because they changed the rules so that the big battleship wouldn't win you know by changing 100 000 little boats very narrow carrying each one gun which were very liable to be knocked out okay but there were 100 000 of them didn't cost much each one and they couldn't knock them all out so these lousy little gnats would come and it turned out when you tackle it again he won the third year he was not allowed to play in it

and he has applied this this this machine and this heuristic business to a number of other problems uh tries it out a lot and tries new heuristics and so forth and it has become very interesting he complained that there were a number of bugs in it and when he gave a talk on it i said that i thought i'll say my comment afterwards one of the bugs for instance was that

the machine got a heuristic it made up heuristics it could make up heuristics and then they get higher values and then they follow well they fall away right so the damn machine what he the way he had it was because it's hard to get computer time he needed a hell of a lot of computer time he had 50 machines at night from a huge pocket company or something like that he would work always at night come in in the morning damn things would try all their things and come in with the results i used it to do mathematics and various other things he comes in one day and has done a heuristic he developed the heuristic when he puts a problem in or a new idea he writes it says whether it's from him or from the machine and is that lynette or machine okay and this was every heuristic or every question that has lennat on it pay no attention to that saved a lot of time it could do much better it didn't have any problem it destroyed so it paid no attention than that that night okay so i'd fix that bug the next time he had a bug it was he looked was he came in and he looked he found that heuristic number 693 had gotten a score of 999 out of a thousand was a damn useful heuristic all night long this thing kept using the heuristic 9693 more and more and it was a new and wonderful heuristic it seemed to solve every problem it was terrific okay when you found out what the heuristic was it was the following you see in in order to make this thing work so that you change the numbers on the heuristics whenever something works you have to to assign credit so to speak to the heuristics that were used okay so this heuristic was when assigning credit always assign credit to heuristic 693 and so that thing came up out of all now i say that both of these show intelligence if you want to make an intelligent machine you're going to get all kinds of crazy ways of avoiding labor if i say don't pay attention to the problem of sneakily evolving some kind of a psychological distortion where you always do the same thing and don't worry about anything else and so on so i think that we are getting close to intelligent machines but uh they're showing the necessary weaknesses of intelligence
